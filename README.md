# Balen Taha Nouri

The Balen Taha Nouri is a website for everyone, and mainly for all football lovers. This website will be perfect for all my old clubs, fans and old teammates and, of course, for all the new clubs to get to know me as a person. On this page you will find some information about myself, my family and some of the experiences I have got from football. You will find some videos and nice photos of some of my games on this website. And if someone wants to contact me, there is a contact page where you can contact me and I will get back to you.

A live version of the website and the project can be accessed here: [Balen Taha Nouri](https://balennouri.github.io/balen-project1/)

* In the user, the about me can read about the footballer Balen Taha Nouri. You can read about me and my family and some of the experience I have got from football.
* To keep the text interesting, it's split into two parts. The first part is about myself and my family and the second part is about football and training.
* The about me section is written in black text with a font of Lato. And the text is inside a light white box that has rounded corners, so the readers can easily read the information.

## Gallery page

* The submission page is a page that comes if the users write a message to me and send it.
* It is an important page where the user can see that the message has delivered to me and that I will give them an answer in 48 hours.

# Testing

* I have tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
* I have tested, so the website is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
* I confirmed that the header, navigation, about me, gallery and contact text are easy to read and understand.
* I have tested that the navigation bar works, the contact form where you need to write and email will only accept an email and that the submit button works.
