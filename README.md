# User Experience Design

## User Demographic

* Football lovers and people who are interested in training.
* Balen Taha Nouri old clubs and fans and for the new ones aswell.

# Design

The goal when the website was designed was that it would be easy to use and that it have a clean layout.

## Colours

The colors used for the website were mainly chosen from the background image that is on all the pages. The background image is a picture of a football pitch from above. The colors are white, black and light white that was used.

## Typography

Google fonts were used to get the right fonts and all the fonts were imported from there. The font of headings on the page has an unik style and was chosen because of the style. It's a fast font and in football speed is an important thing. The font is called Caveat. For the rest of the content on the page, the Lato font was used. In case If the user's browser doesn't read the fonts that are chosen, I put in a second font called Sans-serif for both of them.

# Features

## Known Bugs

### Solved Bugs

All known bugs have been fixed, below is a list of bugs encountered and how they have been fixed.

1. When I first deployed my website to the Github pages, I saw that the images didn't work and that the link was broken to the CSS file. The problem was that I used an absolute file path like you see here:

<img src="assets/images/readme-image/links.png">

* The solution was to remove the "/" in front of the "assets" like you see here:

<img src="assets/images/readme-image/link.png">

2. I had some other issues like navigating from the different pages on the website to the navigation bar.

* The solution was, I went through the files and change the file paths and that solved the problem.

3. On the W3C validator I got one error on the gallery page where I used frame border for the YouTube video inside the HTML file.

* The solution was to remove it from the HTML file and put it in the CSS file.

# Deployment

1. In the GitHub repository, click on the setting tab.
