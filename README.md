# Balen Taha Nouri

The Balen Taha Nouri is a website for everyone, and mainly for all football lovers. This website will be perfect for all my old clubs, fans and old teammates and, of course, for all the new clubs to get to know me as a person. On this page you will find some information about myself, my family and some of the experiences I have got from football. You will find some videos and nice photos of some of my games on this website. And if someone wants to contact me, there is a contact page where you can contact me and I will get back to you.

A live version of the website and the project can be accessed here: [Balen Taha Nouri](https://balennouri.github.io/balen-project1/)

## Known Bugs

### Solved Bugs

All known bugs have been fixed, below is a list of bugs encountered and how they have been fixed.

* When I first deployed my website to the Github pages, I saw that the images didn't work and that the link was broken to the CSS file. The problem was that I used an absolute file path like you see here:

<img src="assets/images/readme-image/links.png">

* The solution was to remove the "/" in front of the "assets" like you see here:

<img src="assets/images/readme-image/link.png">

* I had some other issues like navigating from the different pages on the website to the navigation bar.
* The solution was that I went through the files and change the file paths and that solved the problem.
