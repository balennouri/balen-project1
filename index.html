                <h3>Myself and my family <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    I am Balen Nouri and this is my website. I was born on the first
                    of May 1996. Twenty-seven years later, I have just started my
                    studies in Full Stack Software Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My family includes myself, my younger brother, who is two years
                    younger than me, my older brother who is four years older than
                    me and my mum and dad. Both my brothers are married, my older
                    brother has just had twin daughters. We are originally from
                    Slemani, a town in the eastern Kurdistan region of Irak. We moved
                    to Sweden in 2003 to the capital Stockholm. But now after
                    twenty-one years, we live in Morgong√•va, a village outside
                    Uppsala.

                    Football and training <i class="fa-solid fa-volleyball"></i>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I have dedicated a large part of my life to football and I train
                    all kinds of sports, but mainly football. I'm always training and
                    always trying to do something to activate my body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been playing football at a professional level for a few
                    years now and have gained a lot of experience there. For me,
                    football is a place where I stay physically and mentally healthy,
                    so it's an important part of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, like everything, it comes with disadvantages and
                    advantages. If I start with one disadvantage, the biggest one is
                    that I have missed a lot of time with my family and friends. That
                    is the one that has been the hardest to accept. Something that has
                    helped me a lot with this,
                    is the mobile phone. It has helped to keep in touch with my closest
                    friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of advantages. I have come closer to myself and
                    learned what I should do to keep my mental and physical health in
                    good shape. Sometimes it has been very hard to keep yourself on
                    that path, because there are, of course, a lot of things that can
                    attract you to just do something else. Maybe that day when you are
                    tired and sore after the game you just want to stay in bed and
                    chill and start eating bad things and do other things that will
                    not help your body to recover for the next training session.
