            <p>
              I am Balen Nouri and this is my website. I was born on the first
              of May 1996 and now, twenty-seven years later, I have just started
              my studies in Full Stack Software Development. In my family we are
              three brothers with myself and then mom and dad. My two brothers
              are married and my older brother has just had two twin daughters.
              We are originally from Slemani, a town in eastern Kurdistan. We
              moved to Sweden in 2003 to the capital Stockholm, but now, after
              twenty-one years, we live in Morgong√•va, a village outside
              Uppsala.

          <h3>Football and training <i class="fa-solid fa-volleyball"></i></h3>
          <p>
            I have dedicated a large part of my life to football and I train all
            kinds of sports, but mainly football. I train every day and always
            try to do something to activate my body. When I am not training
            football, I am doing something else. I have been playing football at
            a professional level for a few years now and have gained a lot of
            experience there. For me, football is a place where I stay
            physically and mentally healthy, so it's an important part of my
            life. It does have some disadvantages, for example I miss out on a
            lot of time with my family and friends. But it also has a lot of
            advantages. But everything has its price, and I am still learning
            and moving on.
